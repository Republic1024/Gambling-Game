# Gambling-Game


这是一个简单而刺激的赌博游戏
有100个赌徒，他们的赌博技巧相同，初始资金相同
他们互相赌博，资金数额随机
在每10次赌博后记录他们的金钱数据并且排名
你可以通过输出的图片来查看
即使技术和初始资金相同，他们的金钱数量差距也会越来越大
我们能从中学到的，不仅仅是代码技巧

This is a simple and exciting gambling game
There are 100 gamblers with the same gambling skills and the same initial funds
They gambled with each other, the amount of funds was random
Record their money data and rank after every 10 gambles
You can view it through the output picture
Even if the technology and initial capital are the same, the gap in the amount of their money will become larger
What we can learn from it is not just coding skills
